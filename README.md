#Regression
This technique is used to predict the real valued output or near-real valued output, on a given data set. On this technique we analyze the trend in the given data set and predict the values accordingly.

The line represents the predicted values, and dots( above and below) represents the actual values.

So Our main objective is to minimize the distance between two; for this we calculate
#Error Function
  This gives the mean square distance of the data-sets values( Dots on above graph) and predicted values(line). This is given by:
